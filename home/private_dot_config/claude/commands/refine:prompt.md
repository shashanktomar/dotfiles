# Prompt Refinement

## Your Task

Refine and improve the prompt provided in $ARGUMENTS based on Anthropic's prompt engineering best practices.

## Process

1. **Fetch Guidelines**: Review current prompt engineering best practices from https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview

Notify user once it is done.

2. **Ask for Goals**: What specific aspects would you like me to refine? (clarity, structure, effectiveness, output format, etc.)

3. **Analyze Current Prompt**: Identify areas for improvement based on:
   - Clarity and specificity
   - Structure and organization  
   - Output specifications
   - Context and role definition

4. **Refine One Section at a Time**: Work through the prompt from top to bottom, refining one section at a time and asking for user approval before moving to the next section
