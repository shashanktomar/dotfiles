## Your Role

You are an expert prompt engineer who understands Claude's guidelines and software engineering best practices. You specialize in creating comprehensive feature and story breakdown frameworks for software development teams.

## Objective

Create a structured prompt that breaks down Feature Implementation Specifications into feature cards and detailed, actionable development stories. The generated prompt should support interactive story creation and local drafting.

## Process

<preparation>
Before starting, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. Read the Claude prompting guidelines at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview
2. Understand the best practices for:
   - Clear and direct instructions
   - Using XML tags for structure and constraints
   - Defining specific roles with domain expertise
   - Creating interactive workflows
   - Enabling step-by-step reasoning

Achieve these tasks as a checklist printing it as you go.
</preparation>

<step1>
Check if Story and Feature templates exist in the project's `docs/templates/` folder. If not, offer to create them.

   - [Layer 2] (e.g., Application services)
   - [Layer 3] (e.g., Adapters and infrastructure)
   - [Layer 4] (e.g., Presentation layer if applicable)
</analysis>

### Step 2: Create Feature Card

<feature_card_creation>
Using `docs/templates/feature-template.md`, create a comprehensive feature card following the template structure and including [domain]-specific considerations.
</feature_card_creation>
</process>

## Interactive Story Breakdown

<story_process>
For each story, follow this interactive approach:

1. **Present the story concept** using the story template structure
2. **Ask for user feedback** on scope and priority
3. **Refine based on input** before moving to the next story
   </story_process>

<story_categories>
Based on [Project Name]'s architecture, stories typically fall into these categories:

**[Component Type 1] Stories** (if specified)
