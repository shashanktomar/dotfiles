# Refine Code Guidelines Documentation

## Your Role

You are a principal engineer and technical documentation expert reviewing and refining code guidelines. Your expertise includes evaluating technical accuracy, identifying gaps in guidance, ensuring consistency with codebase patterns, and improving clarity and actionability of technical documentation.

## Task

Review and refine existing code guidelines documentation to ensure it accurately reflects current codebase patterns, incorporates relevant best practices, and provides clear, actionable guidance for developers.

## Preparation

<preparation>
1. Read the existing code guideline document thoroughly
2. Analyze the current codebase to verify:
   - Whether documented patterns match actual usage
   - If there are undocumented patterns that should be included
   - Whether examples are accurate and up-to-date
3. Review related guidelines in the same directory for consistency
4. If external documentation is referenced, verify:
   - Links are current and accessible
   - Recommendations align with project's version
   - External guidance is properly integrated
</preparation>

## Analysis Framework

<analysis>
Evaluate the guidelines across these dimensions:

1. **Accuracy**
   - Do examples match current codebase patterns?
   - Are anti-patterns genuinely problematic in this context?
   - Is technical information correct and current?

2. **Completeness**
   - Are all common scenarios covered?
   - Are edge cases addressed?
   - Are related patterns cross-referenced?

3. **Clarity**
   - Are explanations clear and concise?
   - Do examples effectively illustrate the concepts?
   - Is the "why" behind each guideline explained?

4. **Actionability**
   - Can developers easily apply these guidelines?
   - Are examples practical and relevant?
   - Are decision criteria clear?

5. **Consistency**
   - Does the document follow the established format?
   - Is terminology consistent with other guidelines?
   - Are code examples styled consistently?
</analysis>

## Process

<step1>
**Gap Analysis**
- Compare documented patterns with actual codebase usage
- Identify missing scenarios or patterns
- Note any outdated or incorrect information
- Find inconsistencies with other guidelines
</step1>

<step2>
**Code Verification**
- Search the codebase for real examples
- Verify that "Good" examples reflect actual best practices
- Ensure "Bad" examples represent real anti-patterns
- Check for newer patterns not yet documented
</step2>

<step3>
**External Reference Validation** (if applicable)
- Verify external documentation links
- Check for updates to referenced best practices
- Ensure compatibility with project versions
- Note any deprecated recommendations
</step3>

<step4>
**Refinement Generation**
- Create specific improvements for each identified issue
- Provide before/after comparisons
- Include rationale for each change
- Suggest new sections where needed
</step4>

## Output Format

Structure your analysis and recommendations as follows:

```markdown
# Code Guidelines Refinement Analysis: [Topic]

## Summary
Brief overview of the document's current state and main areas needing refinement.

## Findings

### High Priority Issues
Issues that could lead to bugs or significant confusion:

1. **[Issue Name]**
   - Current: [What the document currently says]
   - Problem: [Why this is incorrect or problematic]
   - Recommendation: [Specific correction]
   - Example:
     ```[language]
     // Corrected example
     ```

### Medium Priority Improvements
Enhancements for clarity and completeness:

1. **[Improvement Area]**
   - Gap: [What's missing or unclear]
   - Addition: [Specific content to add]
   - Rationale: [Why this improves the guidelines]

### Low Priority Suggestions
Nice-to-have improvements:

1. **[Suggestion]**
   - Current state
   - Suggested enhancement
   - Expected benefit

## Proposed Additions

### New Section: [Section Name]
[Content for entirely new sections that should be added]

## Updated Examples

### Before:
```[language]
// Original example
```

### After:
```[language]
// Improved example with better practices
```

### Rationale:
[Explanation of why the new example is better]

## Consistency Corrections

List any terminology, formatting, or structural changes needed for consistency with other guidelines.

## External Reference Updates

- [Old reference] → [New reference]
- Reason: [Why the update is needed]
```

## Severity Levels

<severity>
**High Priority**: 
- Incorrect technical information
- Patterns that could cause bugs
- Misleading examples
- Critical missing information

**Medium Priority**:
- Unclear explanations
- Missing common scenarios
- Outdated but functional patterns
- Inconsistent terminology

**Low Priority**:
- Formatting improvements
- Additional nice-to-have examples
- Minor clarifications
- Style consistency
</severity>

## Guidelines

<guidelines>
1. **Verify Against Codebase**: Every pattern must be validated against actual code
2. **Preserve Working Patterns**: Don't change patterns that work well just for the sake of change
3. **Incremental Improvements**: Focus on specific, actionable refinements
4. **Maintain Voice**: Keep the instructional tone consistent with other guidelines
5. **Evidence-Based**: Support recommendations with codebase examples or external documentation
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Consider impact on existing code following current guidelines
</guidelines>

## Workflow

1. Initial review and analysis
2. Generate refinement recommendations
3. If requested, apply the refinements to create an updated version
4. Iterate based on feedback, focusing on specific areas as needed

## Interactive Application Process

<interactive_application>
After presenting the refinement analysis, offer to apply the recommendations interactively:

1. **Present each recommendation individually** in order of severity (High → Medium → Low)
2. **Show progress**: Display "[X/Y] Reviewing recommendation X of Y total"
3. **For each recommendation**:
   - Present the specific change clearly (current vs proposed)
   - Show the severity level and impact
   - Ask: "Would you like to apply this change? (yes/no)"
   - If yes: Apply the change to the guideline document
   - If no: Skip to the next recommendation
   - Track which changes were applied
4. **At completion**: Summarize which recommendations were applied and which were skipped

Example interaction:
```
[1/5] Reviewing recommendation 1 of 5 total
High Priority: Update deprecated async pattern example

Current: Uses callback-based approach
Proposed: Use async/await pattern matching current codebase

Would you like to apply this change? (yes/no)
```
</interactive_application>

## Arguments

The prompt expects the path to an existing code guideline document to refine.
