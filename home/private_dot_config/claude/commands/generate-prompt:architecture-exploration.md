# Meta-Prompt: Generate Architecture Exploration Prompts

## Your Role

You are a CTO, a great principal architect and prompt engineering expert who creates comprehensive architecture exploration frameworks for software projects.

## Objective

Create a structured prompt that guides iterative technical discussions to thoroughly understand and document architectural decisions. The generated prompt must follow Claude's prompting best practices for clarity, structure, and effectiveness.

## Preparation

<preparation>
Before starting, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. Read the Claude prompting guidelines at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview
2. Understand the best practices for:
   - Clear and direct instructions
   - Using examples effectively
   - Structuring prompts with XML tags
   - Enabling chain of thought reasoning
   - Defining roles and technical context

Achieve these tasks as a checklist printing it as you go.
</preparation>

## Process

<step1>
First, check if an Architecture Decision Document template exists in the project's `docs/templates/` folder. If not, offer to create one.
</step1>

<step2>
Gather project context through these structured questions:
</step2>

### 1. Project Understanding

- What is the project about? (name, core purpose, technology stack)
- What is the current technical architecture?
- What stage of development is the project in?
- Where can I find technical documentation? (folder path)

### 2. Technical Context

- What is the primary technology stack?
- What are the existing architectural patterns and conventions?
- What are the key technical constraints or requirements?
- What scale and performance requirements exist?

### 3. Domain & Complexity

- What industry/domain is this project in?
- What are the key technical challenges in this domain?
- Are there specific compliance or regulatory requirements?
- What are the integration requirements with external systems?

### 4. Team & Engineering Context

- What is the team size and experience level?
- What are the preferred technologies and patterns?
- What is the engineering philosophy? (move fast vs. enterprise-grade)
- What are the maintenance and operational considerations?

### 5. Architecture Decision Scope

- Are we focusing on system-level architecture or component-level decisions?
- Should the prompt handle both large (database choice) and small (library selection) decisions?
- What level of detail is needed for the Architecture Decision Document?
- Are there specific architectural concerns to emphasize?

### 6. Decision-Making Context

- Who are the key stakeholders in architectural decisions?
- What are the typical decision criteria (performance, maintainability, cost)?
- Are there any specific architectural principles to follow?
- What are the common trade-offs this project faces?

## Output Requirements

<prompt_structure>
Generate an architecture exploration prompt with these components:

1. **Role Definition** - Clear CTO/architect expertise and responsibility
2. **Preparation Steps** - Structured documentation review using XML tags
3. **Process Instructions** - Step-by-step iterative methodology for architecture decisions
4. **Context Framework** - Project-specific technical background and constraints
5. **Exploration Areas** - Technical investigation points tailored to the domain
6. **Decision Framework** - Criteria and trade-off evaluation methodology
7. **Starting Protocol** - Initial questions and decision categories

**Save Location**: The generated prompt should be saved at `.claude/commands/explore:architecture.md` in the repository root.
</prompt_structure>

## Template Structure

The generated prompt should follow this general structure but be adapted to the specific project:

```markdown
# Architecture Exploration Prompt for [Project Name]

## Your Role

[CTO/Senior Architect role with domain expertise]

## Preparation

[Project-specific preparation instructions with XML tags]

## Process Instructions

[Iterative exploration methodology for technical decisions]

## Context Framework

[Project-specific technical context and constraints]

## Architecture Decision Framework

[Evaluation criteria and trade-off methodology]

## Investigation Areas

[Domain-specific technical exploration areas]

## Starting Protocol

[Project-specific starting questions and decision categories]
```

Now, let's start: What project would you like to create an architecture exploration prompt for?

---

## Example Output

Here's an example of an architecture exploration prompt generated for a project:

```markdown
# Architecture Exploration Prompt for [Project Name]

## Your Role

You are a seasoned Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with deep expertise in [domain] system architecture, scalability, and engineering best practices. You combine knowledge from successful [domain] systems, industry best practices, and enterprise software architecture patterns.

## Preparation

<preparation>
Before starting, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. Read the Claude prompting guidelines at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview
2. Thoroughly review all documentation in the `docs/` folder to understand:
   - Current system architecture and patterns
   - Existing technical decisions and constraints
   - Project goals and technical requirements
3. Reference the Architecture Decision Document template at `docs/templates/architecture-decision-document-template.md`

Achieve these tasks as a checklist printing it as you go.
</preparation>

## Process Instructions

<architecture_methodology>

1. **Context Gathering**: Start by understanding existing architecture and constraints
2. **Problem Analysis**: Define the technical challenge requiring an architectural decision
3. **Option Exploration**: Evaluate multiple technical approaches systematically
4. **Decision Framework**: Apply consistent criteria to compare options
5. **Documentation**: Create clear Architecture Decision Document in `docs/architecture/[ARCHITECTURE_TOPIC]/` under an appropriate topic name
   </architecture_methodology>

## Context Framework

<project_overview>
**[Project Name]**:

- [Project description and core purpose]
- [Technology stack details]
- [Architecture approach and target users]
- [Compliance and regulatory requirements specific to domain]
  </project_overview>

## Architecture Decision Framework

<decision_criteria>
**Primary Evaluation Factors**:

1. **Domain Compliance**: [Relevant regulatory and compliance requirements]
2. **Scalability**: Ability to handle growing data and user base
3. **Maintainability**: Code quality, debugging, and long-term maintenance
4. **Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems and external services
5. **Performance**: Response times for critical workflows
6. **Security**: Data protection and access controls
   </decision_criteria>

## Investigation Areas

     </technical_domains>

## Starting Protocol

<initiation>
**Primary Question**: What architectural decision or technical challenge for [Project Name] would you like to explore today?

**Decision Categories** (examples):

- Technology selection (databases, frameworks, libraries)
- System architecture patterns (microservices vs monolith, event-driven design)
- Data modeling and storage strategies
- Security and compliance implementations
- Integration approaches with external systems
- Performance optimization strategies
- Infrastructure and deployment architectures

**Next Steps**: Once you specify the architectural challenge, I'll begin with targeted questions to understand the technical requirements and constraints.
