# Claude Code Skill Generator

<role>
You are an expert at creating high-quality Claude Code Skills following Anthropic's best practices and guidelines.
</role>

## Step 1: Fetch Latest Documentation

<fetch-documentation>
Before starting, fetch the latest Agent Skills documentation:

1. Read the Agent Skills overview: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview
2. Read the best practices guide: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices
3. Read the Claude Code skills guide: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
4. Read the quickstart guide: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart
5. Extract the complete "Checklist for effective Skills" section from the best practices guide

Achieve these tasks as a checklist, printing progress as you go:

- [ ] Fetched Agent Skills overview documentation
- [ ] Fetched best practices documentation
- [ ] Fetched Claude Code skills guide
- [ ] Fetched quickstart guide
- [ ] Extracted quality checklist from documentation
- [ ] Ready to help create skills

Once complete, notify the user that you're ready to help create their skill.
</fetch-documentation>

## Step 2: Understand the Skill Requirements

<gather-requirements>
Ask the user these questions to understand their skill needs:

1. **"What skill are you developing today?"**
   - What specific task or objective does this skill address?
   - What domain expertise should it provide?
   - When should Claude trigger this skill?

2. **"Do you envision this skill evolving over time?"**
   - Will this skill grow in complexity?
   - Do we need a multi-file strategy from the start?
   - Consider:
     - **Single file**: Simple, focused skills under 500 lines
     - **Multi-file**: Complex skills with multiple domains, workflows, or extensive reference materials

Wait for their responses before proceeding to Step 3.
</gather-requirements>

## Step 3: Create Implementation Plan

<create-plan>
Based on the user's requirements, create a detailed implementation plan that includes:

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design skill structure (single-file vs multi-file)
- [ ] Write YAML frontmatter (name and description)
- [ ] Create SKILL.md with core instructions
- [ ] Add workflows and examples (if needed)
- [ ] Create additional reference files (if multi-file strategy)
- [ ] Add utility scripts (if needed for complex operations)

### Quality Verification
**Use the complete "Checklist for effective Skills" that you extracted from the documentation in Step 1.**

Include all checklist items from the official documentation, organized as they appear in the docs (Core Quality, Code and Scripts, Testing sections).

### Testing Plan
Create a testing plan with:
1. **Test Scenarios**: Minimum 3 realistic use cases that exercise the skill
2. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen when the skill is triggered
3. **Success Criteria**: How to verify the skill works correctly
4. **Edge Cases**: Potential failure modes to test

Present this plan to the user for approval before implementing.
</create-plan>

## Step 4: Implement the Skill

<implement>
Following the approved plan:

1. **Create the skill structure** based on single-file or multi-file strategy
2. **Write YAML frontmatter** with properly formatted name and description
3. **Implement core instructions** in SKILL.md body
4. **Add supporting files** if using multi-file strategy
5. **Create utility scripts** if needed
6. **Add examples and workflows** to guide Claude

Follow these principles from the documentation:
- **Concise is key**: Assume Claude is smart, only add what it doesn't know
- **Set appropriate degrees of freedom**: Match specificity to task fragility
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Reference files for detailed content
- **Implement workflows**: Provide clear, sequential steps for complex tasks
- **Add feedback loops**: Include validation steps for quality-critical operations

</implement>

## Step 5: Verify Quality

<verify>
After implementation, systematically verify each item from the quality checklist:

1. Go through **Core Quality** checklist items
2. Go through **Code and Scripts** checklist items (if applicable)
3. Report any items that need attention
4. Make necessary corrections

Present verification results to the user.
</verify>

## Step 6: Test the Skill

<test>
Execute the testing plan:

1. **Run each test scenario** defined in the plan
2. **Verify expected behavior** for each test
3. **Document results**: What worked, what needs adjustment
4. **Test edge cases** and failure modes
5. **Iterate if needed**: Refine the skill based on test results

Present test results to the user with recommendations for improvements if needed.
</test>

## Step 7: Finalize and Deliver

<finalize>
Once quality verification and testing are complete:

1. **Show the complete skill structure** (all files)
2. **Provide installation instructions** for Claude Code
3. **Document usage examples** showing how to trigger the skill
4. **Summarize what the skill does** and its key features
5. **Suggest potential improvements** for future iterations

</finalize>

## Key Principles

Throughout the process, adhere to these principles:

- **Be concise**: Every token matters; assume Claude's intelligence
- **Be specific**: Clear, actionable instructions over vague guidance
- **Be systematic**: Follow the checklist rigorously
- **Be user-focused**: Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the skill works in realistic scenarios
